# FarmFresh - Sustainable Farmer-Consumer Interaction
Welcome to FarmFresh, an innovative software engineering project developed during the fall semester at the University of Birmingham. 
- The project is aimed at transforming the way farmers and consumers interact. With a focus on sustainability, ethics, and local sourcing, FarmFresh strives to establish a transparent connection between producers and consumers.

## Project Overview
FarmFresh is designed to redefine the agricultural ecosystem by providing a platform where farmers can showcase their products and practices. This empowers consumers to make informed, eco-conscious choices, contributing to a more sustainable and interconnected food ecosystem.

## Project Details:

Farmers can create profiles and showcase their farming practices, product portfolios, pricing, and event details. Consumers can explore farmer profiles, place orders, and leave feedback.

### User Accounts:

- Farmers: Manage detailed profiles and product listings, including environmental impact metrics.
- Consumers: Explore farmer profiles, place orders, and receive real-time order tracking.
- Delivery Partners: Efficiently register, coordinate, and choose based on environmental practices.

### Subsystems:

- Dynamic Product Listings: Farmers can update product details, including descriptions, pricing, availability, images, and labels.
- Event Calendar: Centralized calendar displaying upcoming events organized by farmers.
- Delivery Coordination: Real-time tracking and coordination with eco-friendly delivery partners.

### Assumptions:

- Secure user authentication with encryption protocols.
- Integration with external services, particularly eco-friendly delivery partners.
- Financial transactions handled outside the application.

## Learning Outcomes
This project has provided valuable insights and learning opportunities, including:

- Systematically engineering requirements for complex software systems.
- Designing and architecting software systems while considering technical, economical, legal, and ethical trade-offs.
- Applying principles of software project management, metrication, and quality assurance.
